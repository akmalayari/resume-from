# Host shims

The host shims expose one core implementation as `/resume-from`.

- Pi uses `resume-from` and `shims/pi/extensions/resume-from.js`.
- Claude Code uses `@alexeiled/resume-from-claude` and
  `commands/resume-from.md`.
- Codex uses `@alexeiled/resume-from-codex` and `prompts/resume-from.md`.

## Boundaries

The core package owns discovery, transfer, preview, and confirmation. A shim
contains no transfer rules.

Claude Code and Codex supply `--target-agent`. They do not detect the target
from the environment. Only the user supplies `--confirm`.

The Pi shim uses `registerCommand`, `ui.select`, `ui.confirm`, and
`switchSession`. It keeps the live command context only until the session switch
is complete.

## Package staging

Run this command to stage the three npm packages:

```sh
npm run packages:stage
```

The command writes generated packages to `build/npm/`.

Run this command to inspect the npm files and manifests:

```sh
npm run packages:check
```

The Claude Code package contains its command binary. The Codex package pins the
matching core package version.
