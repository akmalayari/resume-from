/**
 * Which entry point runs, and starting it.
 *
 * C-1 forces two mechanisms: Codex and Claude Code cannot host the command, so they call a
 * binary; Pi can, and its switch needs a live command context (C-10), so it loads an extension
 * in-process. Exactly one of them runs per process, and which one is read from the target
 * adapter's declared `selection` level — never from its name (FR-43, FR-58).
 *
 * The two starts are not symmetrical, and that is the design rather than an omission: the binary
 * is handed an invocation and answers with an outcome, while the extension is handed the live
 * context C-10 proved the switch needs and answers by registering a command.
